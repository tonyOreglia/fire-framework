              How much time does the FIRE Method take each day?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The daily Flow practice takes just 15-20 minutes. Indexing adds
              another 2-3 minutes. Monthly reflections require 30-60 minutes,
              and Extract collection is part of that reflection time. In total,
              you're looking at about 20-25 minutes per day, plus one longer
              session each month.

              Can I practice FIRE digitally instead of on paper?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Yes. While many people enjoy the tactile experience of paper
              journaling, the FIRE Method works beautifully in digital formats.
              Digital tools can make indexing and searching even more powerful.
              Use whatever medium helps you maintain consistency.

              What if I miss a day or several days?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Consistency is helpful, but perfection isn't required. If you miss
              days, simply pick up where you left off. The system is designed to
              accommodate life's natural ebbs and flows. Some people even
              practice FIRE just a few times per week with great results.

              Do I need special journaling prompts for FIRE?
            </h3>
            <p>
              No. Flow of thought journaling only works when it comes from your
              authentic thoughts and feelings in the moment. Prompts distract
              you from the natural gravity of your current internal dialogue.
              Some initial discomfort is normal, but I assure you, if you keep
              the pen moving, you'll find a deep vein of ideas waiting to be
              expressed.

              How long before I see results from the FIRE Method?
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you have been in a state of heavy consumption and doom
              scrolling, the simple of shifting the mind into a mode of creation
              will instantly relieve some anxiety. The deeper insights and
              pattern recognition typically emerge after the first monthly
              reflection. The Extract collection becomes increasingly valuable
              over time, with many people finding it transformative after 3-6
              months of consistent practice.
